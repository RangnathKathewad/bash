Deletion Protection is ENABLE or DISABLE on VM instances

1	Setting deletion protection during instance creation

When creating a VM instance, include either the --deletion-protection or no-deletion-protection flags. Deletion protection is disabled by default so to enable deletion protection:

gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] --deletion-protection
			
			OR

gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] --no-deletion-protection


2	Determining if an instance has deletion protection enabled

gcloud compute instances describe example-instance | grep "deletionProtection"

Output:-	deletionProtection: false

3	for existing instances

gcloud compute instances update [INSTANCE_NAME] \
    [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]

gcloud compute instances update example-vm --deletion-protection
